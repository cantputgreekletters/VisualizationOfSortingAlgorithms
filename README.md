# VisualizationOfSortingAlgorithms
 A couple of algorithms that visualize sorting algorithms

# Selection Sorting

[The algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/) repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted. 
    

# Bubble Sort

[Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/) is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
